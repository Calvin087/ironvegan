# Contributing to the project.

## Clone the project to your machine

`git clone https://github.com/Calvin087/ironvegan.git`

## Get all new changes from team

Do this BEFORE working on the project **every time**  
`git fetch`  
`git pull`

# Starting a new Tarea

Start by creating a new BRANCH. This means we can work on the project at the same time, without destroying the other person's changes.

### Create a new branch with [task_name]

`git checkout -b creating-readme`

Make your changes and save the files.

### Sending NEW Branch changes to Github

`git add .`  
`git commit -m 'setting up instructions for contributions'`  
`git push origin creating-readme`
